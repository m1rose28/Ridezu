					<h2>Our Mission</h2> 
					
					<p>Over 100 million americans drive to work every day - alone.  At the same time traffic is congested in most US cities, the price of gasoline is increasing at twice the rate of inflation, and the amount of pollution being belched out by cars is simply staggering.</p>  
					<p>Since we're all going the same direction, why not get together?</p>
					<p>Simply, it's tough - coordination is difficult, everyone has different hectic schedules, and let's agree - it's a little socially awkward.</p>
					<p>Ridezu is a mobile-social platform to help us all get together and massively change the way we get to work. Our mission is to get 30 million cars off the road, reduce costs for both driving and riding, and help improve the environment.</p>
					<p>It's a hugely ambitious project, and we hope you'll join us. </p>

							<h3>Mark Rose</h3>
							<h4>CEO, Founder</h4>
							<p>Mark has been driving up, down and across Silicon Valley for the past 20 years, sometimes carpooling, other times wishing he was carpooling.  The entire time, he's had this idea in the back of his head that the way we get to work is fundamentally very inefficient and wrong.  Why do 9 out of 10 cars have a single passenger?  Why doesn't Bart get to my neighborhood?  Do we really have to send this much pollution into the air?  Couldn't we do this better?</p>
							<p>As CEO of Ridezu, Mark works tirelessly towards delighting users and making carpooling a truly preferred way to get to work.  </p>
							<p>Mark is a serial entrepreneur and consumer product zealot.  Mark co-founded Spare Change Payments which was acquired by PlaySpan, which was subsequently acquired by Visa.  Mark has over 20 years product experience across a number of great Silicon Valley brands and startups including:  PayPal, Yodlee, HedgeStreet and E*TRADE.</p>

							<h3>John Hagelgans</h3>
							<h4>Vice President, Development</h4>
							<p>John is an avid biker who bikes or walks to work whenever possible. Of course weather, distance, time pr<essure all get in the way so the commute comes into play. At one point Mark and John carpooled to work. Now Mark and John work together at a carpooling company.</p>
							<p>John is the technical wizard of Ridezu, and if you've ever used Yahoo! Finance, you have already seen John's work. John has also spent a lot of time working for stock exchanges and hedgefunds on technical solutions for order routing and matching engines.</p>
							<p>At Ridezu, John is now matching people so they can ride together, "Tame the commute jungle with Ridezu".</p>

							<h3>Jeff Thompson</h3>
							<h4>Vice President, Business Development</h4>
							<p>As a San Francisco Bay Area native, Jeff has witnessed first hand the amazing growth of Silicon Valley and the gnarled traffic congestion that growth has caused.  He has spent the last 22 years commuting all across the SF bay area always hoping for a better, stress free way to get to work.  As a San Francisco resident working in Palo Alto, he was appalled by the exorbitant cost and inefficient mass transit options and wondered “Why does it take 2 to 3 transit systems to get from SF to Palo Alto?”.  As an environmental advocate, he couldn’t stand the guilt of contributing to our planet’s pollution problem.  There has to be a better solution.</p>
							<p>As Vice President of Business Development at Ridezu, Jeff is working day and night to bring a better solution to all those out there suffering the same fate.  He knows that seamless carpooling is that better solution.</p>
							<p>Jeff is a Silicon Valley startup veteran who thrives on taking companies from launch to profitability to exit.  He has 15 years of experience in business development, client services, and sales working for several large brands and startups including: AOL (via acquisition), Excite@Home (via acquisition), Tribal Fusion, PubMatic, and E*TRADE.  When he’s not busy solving the world’s carpooling problems, Jeff can be found underwater photographing the amazing sea life among the world’s coral reefs.</p>
