						<h2>Benefits of Ridezu</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">It’s economical</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>It costs the average American about $1,500 to drive to work each year, just factoring the price of gas.  Including the costs of wear and tear on your car, or if you have to pay tolls or parking, the costs become much, much higher.</p>
							<p>By carpooling, you effectively share these costs with other drivers.  This can reduce your costs by 50% or more.  Who doesn’t want to save an extra $1,000? </p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">It’s convenient</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu makes carpooling convenient by giving you pick up options near your home - to your office - at times that are flexible to your schedule.
							<p>If you’re a driver - keep your current schedule and simply pick up riders on your way in.
							<p>If you’re a rider - catch up on some emails on the way into the office.  It's not illegal to text and ride!</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">It’s green</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Over 100 million Americans drive to work every day - alone.
							<p>Each year this generates an estimated 170 billion meters of CO2.  Since that’s an awfully big number, and we’re not on the metric system, try and imagine 68 million Olympic swimming pools filled to the rim with C02.  Blech!   
							<p>Ridezu’s goal is to take 30 million cars off the road - and we need your help. </p> 
						</div> 
						
						<h2>Benefits for Drivers</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Offset your gas and maintenance costs</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you use Ridezu, riders help offset your costs.  At about $.10 a mile, plus equal sharing in tolls and parking fees, this can add up to thousands of dollars a year.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Stay in control of your schedule</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you use Ridezu, you set the schedule.  Post rides when you want to go to work and when you want to go home.  This gives your control over your schedule.</p> 
						</div> 						
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Enjoy the ride you already have</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You’re already going to work.  You already enjoy your car.  You enjoy your flexibility and freedom of movement.  You’re just taking advantage of the empty seats you already have.</p> 
						</div> 	
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Pick up riders at places that are convenient to you</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu creates pickup spots that are close to your home, often only a mile away and near the freeway or major road that takes you to your office.  Simply stop by the pick up spot and pick up your riders. </p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Reduce traffic congestion</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Over 100 million Americans driver to work every day, alone.  Today - you’re one of them.  By carpooling, we can radically reduce the amount of cars on the road making getting to work faster for everyone.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Help reduce C02 emissions and save the environment</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you offer a carpool, you’re taking another car, or more, off the road.  This reduces CO2 emissions enormously.  Even a single car going to work every year generates almost enough C02 to fill up a single Olympic swimming pool.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Help reduce America’s dependence on oil</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Oil prices are going up.  Gas prices are going up.  While we continue to drill for oil, we’re not but making more oil.  In fact, many scientists agree that we have already passed “peak oil” - which is the point at which 50% of the world’s oil is already consumed.  By carpooling you are contributing to a national effort to reduce America on our dependence on oil.</p> 
						</div> 
 
						<h2>Benefits for Riders</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Reduce your gas costs by 25%, and more</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you use Ridezu, your cost is about $0.10 per mile plus a $0.25 fee to Ridezu.  This price you pay to Ridezu is on average 25% less then what you would pay in gas, not to mention the wear and tear on your car, which is typically much higher.  If you also include cost sharing for tolls and parking, Ridezu can save you 50% or more per year on your commute costs.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Be productive on the way to work</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>The great thing about being a rider is that you can sit in the car and get something done.  Answer some emails.  Look up some stock quotes.  Play a game (ok so that’s not productive, but it’s still fun).  Or just look out the window at the other people who have to focus on driving while you’re relaxing.  Sweet deal.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Keep flexibility in your schedule</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you use Ridezu you can select from different drivers leaving at different times, and we’re working aggressively at getting more and more people to carpool which give you more and more options.  Need to leave early or late?  Chances are there is someone else that’s working early or late too!</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Get picked up at places that are convenient to you</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu creates pickup spots that are close to your home, often only a mile away and near the freeway or major road that takes you to your office.  Simply stop by the pickup spot and get taken to the office.  </p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Reduce your costs</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Chances are that you’re putting on about 10 to 20 thousand miles on your car each year just getting to and from the office.  When you carpool you can reduce this number to just a few thousand.  This will greatly reduce the maintenance costs, elongate it’s life, and improve it’s value at resale time when you want to upgrade.  Plus, you’ll get alot less car dings at the office!</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Reduce traffic congestion</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Over 100 million Americans driver to work every day, alone.  Today - you’re one of them.  By carpooling, we can radically reduce the amount of cars on the road making getting to work faster for everyone.  Plus now as a rider, you don’t really have to worry about the frustration of traffic.  Just get some work done or play a game on your phone!</p>
