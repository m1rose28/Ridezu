						<h2>Benefits of Ridezu</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">It’s economical</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>It costs the average American about $1,500 per year to drive to and from work each day. And guess what, that figure only takes the price of gas into consideration!  If you include the high cost of wear and tear (i.e. brakes, tires, oil changes, tune ups, etc.) on your vehicle the costs become much, much higher.  Oh, and don’t forget about tolls, parking, higher insurance costs, and any tickets you might get while speeding your way to work.</p>
							<p>By carpooling, you offset these costs with other riders and drivers.  (Okay, not the speeding tickets.  Nice try.  But you get our point.)  In effect, you potentially reduce your costs by 50% or more just by sharing those empty seats in your car or taking advantage of those empty seats as a rider.  Who wouldn’t want an extra $1,000 in their pocket every year?</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">It’s convenient</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu makes carpooling convenient by providing pick up options near your home and office.  We call them Ride Hubs.  Our service automatically seeks out your nearest Home Hub and Work Hub so catching a ride or picking someone up is now easier than ever.  If you’re driving, just keep to your schedule and pick people up on your way into the office or on your way home.  If you are riding, just grab a ride near your home or office and catch up on email, watch an episode of The Daily Show, or just relax.  Congratulations!  Your commute just became productive.</p>
						</div>  
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">It’s green</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Over 100 million Americans drive to work every day...alone.  This generates an estimated 170 billion cubic meters of C02.  Yikes!  That’s an awfully big number and we’re not on the metric system so try and imagine 68 million Olympic swimming pools filled to the rim with C02.  Blech!   Ridezu’s goal is to take 30 million cars off the road.  We need your help.  Are you in?</p>
						</div> 
						
						<h2>Benefits for Drivers</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Offset your gas and maintenance costs</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you use Ridezu, the credit you earn from riders will help offset your costs.  At roughly $0.10 a mile, plus equal sharing of tolls and parking fees, this can add up to thousands of dollars a year depending on distance and the number of rides you provide.  One rider is good, two riders in your car is great!  Challenge yourself and see how much you can earn in a year.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Stay in control of your schedule</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>As a Ridezu driver, you set the schedule.  Post rides when you want to go to work and when you want to go home.  You are in total control of your schedule.</p> 
						</div> 						
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Enjoy the ride you already have</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Nice wheels!  You enjoy your car and the freedom and flexibility it provides.  Yet, you’re already driving to and from work every single day stuck in traffic.  (Well, you should be anyway.  We promise not to tell your boss.) With Ridezu, you’re just taking advantage of those empty seats next to you.  Wouldn’t you rather drive those sweet wheels faster than 10 MPH?  With a rider or two in your rig you can say hello to the carpool lane.  Zoom!</p> 
						</div> 	
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Pick up riders at places that are convenient to you</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu automatically creates pickup spots called Ride Hubs that are close to your home and office.  The Hubs are often a mile or less away and are near the freeway or major road that takes you to your work or home.  Simply stop by the Hub and pick up your riders.</p>

						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Reduce traffic congestion</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Over 100 million Americans drive to work every day...alone.  Today, you’re one of them.  (Don’t worry, we’re here to help.)  By carpooling, we can radically reduce the number of cars on the road and make getting to work faster for everyone.  (In BuzzWord Bingo that’s a “win win” for those of you playing along at home.)</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Save the environment and reduce C02 emissions</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>When you make your empty seats available to fellow commuters, you’re helping to take cars off the road.  Fill one seat, take one car off the road.  Fill two seats, take two cars off the road.  Fill three seats and you might win the Nobel Peace Prize. (Okay, probably not but you get the point.)  This reduces CO2 emissions enormously.  A single car going to work every day in a year will generate enough C02 to fill up an Olympic size swimming pool.  No one wants to swim in that pool.  But, guess what?  We are all swimming in that pool now.  It’s called the air we breathe.  Let’s clean this pool together.  Are you with us?</p>

						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Help reduce America’s dependence on oil</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Foreign and domestic.  Oil prices are going up.  Gas prices are going up.  While we continue to drill for oil around the world, we’re not making more oil.  In fact, many scientists agree that we have already passed “peak oil”.  Peak oil is the point where 50% of the world’s oil is already consumed.  By carpooling you are contributing to a national effort that helps reduce our dependence on oil.  Together, we will make a massive change and lower our consumption.  Join us! </p>

						<h2>Benefits for Riders</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Reduce your gas costs by 25%, and more</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu is the best way to reduce your commuting costs.  Riders pay about $0.10 per mile plus a $0.25 transaction fee.  The total cost to you averages 25% less than what you would pay in gas alone if you drove by yourself.  If you add the cost of wear and tear (i.e. brakes, tires, oil changes, tune ups, etc.) on your vehicle your savings dramatically increase.  Add in the benefit of cost sharing for tolls and parking and Ridezu is now saving you 50% or more per year on your commute costs.  How sweet is that?</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Be productive or relax</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Do you know what’s great about being a Ridezu rider?  You’re not driving.  How’d you like to get 60 minutes or more back in your day?  Just think of all the things you could do with that time.  Answer some email.  Buy and sell stock like Gordon Gekko.  Play a game! (Okay, so that’s not productive, but you know what they say, all work and no play.)  Or you could unplug, do nothing, and just relax.  Who couldn’t use a little downtime these days?  However you choose to use your newfound time is up to you.  Either way, you win!</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Stay in control of your schedule</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu riders get to select from a number of different drivers leaving at different times.  Need to leave early or late?  No problem.  Chances are there is someone else that’s working early or late as well.  Our proprietary Ride Match technology will help you to catch a ride with them and you’re good to go!  Here at Ridezu we are working hard each day to bring more people into the Ridezu Network and we are adding new Ride Hubs all the time.  More people and more Ride Hubs equals even more flexibility and control for you.  Would you like to help?  Click here to tell a friend or five.  </p>

						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Convenient pick up locations</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu creates pickup spots we call Ride Hubs that are close to your home and office. Most of the time these will be less than a mile away.  We also try and place Ride Hubs near freeways and major roads that most people use to get to and from work.  Simply walk, bike, or drive to your Ride Hub, meet up with your driver, and off to work you go!  (Whistling like the 7 dwarves on your way to work is not recommended.) </p>

						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Improve your car's resale value</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Already own a car?  Most of us do.  Chances are you’re putting about 10 to 20 thousand miles on your car each year just getting to and from the office.  By becoming a Ridezu rider you will drastically reduce that number.  You will significantly reduce your vehicle maintenance costs, elongate the life of your vehicle, and improve it’s resale value when it is time to trade in the old Honda for that Ferrari.  Oh, and another bonus.  You know that mysterious co-worker who always seems to ding your car door in the company parking lot?  Take that mysterious co-worker!  Try to ding my door now.  Here at Ridezu, we call that a win!</p>
