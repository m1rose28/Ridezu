						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What is Ridezu?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu is service which draws together different people for carpooling.  Our roads are dominated by single passenger cars.  This is wasteful.  Ridezu can change that.  </p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Why carpool anyway?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Driving a car to and from work is much more expensive than you think.  Besides the cost of gas, there is also the wear and tear on your car, the cost of traffic jams - stalling people from doing what’s important to them, and the cost on the environment.  By carpooling, you can save of gas (who doesn’t want to save some money), contribute to reducing cars on the road - increasing your productivity and send less C02 in the atmosphere.  It’s just better.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Does it work?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Yes it does.  And the more people that use it the better it gets.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Is it safe?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Yes it is.  Ridezu is about working professionals getting to and from work.  We also show you key details from riders and drivers Facebook profiles so you can feel like you’re getting to know them before you take a ride.  Users are also ranked and scored by the community on important attributes like timeliness and consistency.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2>Basics for Drivers</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I pick up people at their homes?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>No.  Ridezu uses public locations like Park & Rides, which are convenient to you and have easy access to major freeways.  </p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What time do I get to go to work?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You’re the driver, whenever you want to.  However, you’ll want to take some people in your carpool.  Before you go to work you can post a ride at a time that is convenient to you.  Sometimes there will be riders already leaving at that time, and you can pick them up and drive them.  Sometimes, you will be the first person to post a ride at a specific time and location.  Riders will see this opening and try to meet it.  </p> 
						</div> 						
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What time do I get to go home?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You’re the driver, whenever you want to.  Before you come home you can post a ride at a time that is convenient to you.  Sometimes there will be riders already leaving at that time, and you can just pick them up.  Sometimes, you will be the first person to post a ride at a specific time and location.  Riders will see this opening and try to meet it.  </p> 
						</div> 	
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if my schedule changes daily?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That’s ok.  Everyone’s schedule changes daily.  That’s the point of Ridezu.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I carpool with the same person everyday?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That’s really up to you.  You should go to work and come home based on your schedule.  If the same rider can accommodate, that’s great.  If not, that gives other riders an opportunity to ride with you.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if I have to work late or have to work early?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That’s ok.  You’re the driver and can come and leave when you want to.  Always make sure to post a ride when you’re coming and going as early in advance as you can though - this will give you the highest probability that riders will adjust their schedules to get a ride home with you.</p> 
							<p>Sometimes you’ll also get requests from riders to leave earlier or later.  You don’t have to accommodate their schedules but it’s a good idea.  If no one can carpool with you that defeats the purpose. 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if I am late?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Stuff happens.  If you’re late let your rider know right away.  Typically in a case like this you might buy someone a cup of coffee.  And that’s exactly what we do.  When you’re late your account is charged $3 and the rider is credited $3.  It’s good coffee without all the hassle of buying it.  If you’re a no show and you haven’t told anyone we charge your account $10.  Don’t do this.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I get paid for this?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You don’t get “paid” per se, but we do credit your account with an amount to help offset your gas and maintenance costs.  In other words, don’t give up your day job.</p> 
							<p>You basically get what the rider pays, less $0.25, which is what we charge the rider and use to cover our credit card processing costs.  At the end of the month, we send you a payment via PayPal. 
							<p>You can also see a complete listing of all your credits on our app.

						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu costs about 25% less than what you would pay in gas.  Right away you’re saving 25%.  Then, if you factor in wear and tear on your car and the productivity gains you have from not driving yourself, Ridezu becomes a great deal.</p>

						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That’s ok.  We show a list of all people going home.  You can pick the last ride home if that makes sense for you.  You can also request the driver to stay another 30 minutes, and they might.  It’s better to drive home with two than one.  We’ll give you a warning if the last car is about to leave and you’re not on it.  </p>

If you have to go super early, then maybe it’s better to drive yourself and post a ride for other riders to join you.</p>
