						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What is Ridezu?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu is a service that draws different people together for carpooling.  Our roads are dominated by cars carrying only one person.  This is wasteful.  Ridezu enables change, convenience, and efficiency.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Why carpool?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Driving a car to and from work is much more expensive than you might think.  In addition to the cost of gas, there is the wear and tear on your vehicle that increases maintenance costs, traffic jams that cost people precious time and decreased productivity, and of course there is the cost and impact on the environment that affects everyone in the world.  By carpooling, you use less gas (who doesn’t want to save some money?), reduce the number of cars on the road, increase productivity, and send less C02 into the atmosphere.  It is just better...for everyone.</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Does it work?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Yes.  And the more people that use Ridezu the better it gets. </p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Is it safe?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Yes.  Ridezu is designed for working professionals who need to get to and from their office on a daily basis.  We show you key details of riders and drivers from their Facebook profiles so you feel like you’re getting to know them before you take a ride.  Riders and Drivers are also ranked and scored by the community on important attributes like timeliness, consistency, and more.</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do you have an iPhone app yet?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You can use Ridezu on your iPhone and we're working on the native iOS app.  Stay tuned - it will be out shortly.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2>Basics for Driving</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I pick up people at their homes?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>No.  Ridezu uses public locations (e.g. Park & Ride lots) that are convenient to you and have easy access to major freeways.</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What time do I get to go to work?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You’re the driver so you get to choose.  Before you go to work you post a ride at a time that is convenient for you.  Sometimes there will be riders already leaving at that time and Ridezu will connect you with those riders.  Other times, you might be the first person to post a ride at a specific time and location.  Riders will then see this opening and try to meet it. </p>	
						</div> 						
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What time do I get to go home?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You’re the driver so you get to choose.  Before you leave the office and head home you just post a ride at a time that is convenient for you.  Sometimes there will be riders already leaving at that time and Ridezu will connect you with those riders.  Other times, you might be the first person to post a ride at a specific time and location.  Riders will then see this opening and try to meet it.</p>
						</div> 	
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if my schedule changes daily?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That is perfectly okay.  Everyone’s schedule changes daily.  That’s the beauty of Ridezu.  It is designed to be flexible and work with everyone’s constantly changing schedules.</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I carpool with the same person everyday?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That’s really up to you.  We suggest just going to and from work based on your schedule each day.  If the same rider can accommodate, that’s great!  If not, that gives other riders an opportunity to ride with you.</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if I have to work late or have an early morning meeting?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That is perfectly okay.  You’re in the drivers seat.  Literally.  You get to set the schedule and post rides based on your schedule each day.  We suggest that you post a ride as far in advance as you possibly can for each ride.  This will give you the highest probability that riders will adjust their schedules to grab a ride with you.</p>
							<p>From time to time you may receive requests from riders asking if you can leave earlier or later.  You don’t have to accommodate their schedules but if you can, it’s a good idea to do so.  If no one can carpool with you that defeats the purpose.</p>
							</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if I am late?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Stuff happens.  If you’re running late, let your rider know right away.  In a case like this you might buy someone a cup of coffee as a peace offering.  That’s exactly what we do.  When you’re late, your account is charged $3 and the rider is credited $3.  It’s good karma without all the hassle of actually buying a cup of joe.  If you’re a no show and you haven’t told anyone, we charge your account $10.  Please don’t do this.  No one likes a flake.  You’ll also end up with bad reviews and Ridezu ratings that will make it difficult for you to pick up riders in the future.	</p>
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I get paid for this?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>You don’t get “paid” per se, but we do credit your account for each ride you have provided with an amount that helps offset your gas and maintenance costs.  In other words, don’t give up your day job. </p>
							<p>You basically get what the rider pays, less $0.25, which is what we charge the rider and use to cover our credit card processing costs.  At the end of the month, we send you a payment via PayPal. </p>
							<p>You can also see a complete listing of all your credits in your account on the Ridezu app.</p>						</div> 
						<h2>Basics for Riding</h2>
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Does someone pick me up at my house?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>No.  Ridezu uses public locations (e.g. Park & Ride lots) that are close to your home and have easy access to major freeways.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What time do I get picked up for work?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Before you go to work you can request a ride at a time that is convenient for you.  We suggest that you make the request right after you wake up or the night before. Sometimes there will be drivers already leaving at that time, so you’ll be able to ride with one of them.  Other times, you may be the first person to request a ride at a specific time and location.  Drivers will see this opening and try to accommodate the ride request.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What time do I get picked up to go home?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>As afternoon approaches and you have a better idea of what time you would like to head home, you will request a ride at a time that is convenient to you.  Sometimes there will be drivers already leaving at that time, so you’ll be able to ride with one of them.  Other times, you may be the first person to request a ride at a specific time and location.

						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Do I carpool with the same person everyday?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That’s really up to you.  We suggest that you request rides that take you to and from work based on your schedule each day.  If the same driver can accommodate, that’s great!  If not, that gives other drivers an opportunity to drive you.</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">How much does it cost?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>Ridezu costs about 25% less than what you would pay in gas to drive yourself.  From day one you save money.  If you factor in the wear and tear on your vehicle and the productivity gains you receive (e.g. check email, update Facebook, etc.) by not being the driver, Ridezu becomes an amazing deal!</p> 
						</div> 
						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">What if I have to work late?</h2> 
						<div class="faq-content"> 
							<p>That is perfectly okay.  The Ridezu app shows a list of all the drivers going to your home hub.  You can pick the last ride to your home hub if that makes sense for you.  You can also send a request to the driver and ask if they can leave 30 minutes later than scheduled.  If they can, they will likely accommodate the request.  Drivers are encouraged to maximize the seat usage in their cars.  At Ridezu we don’t want you to be left stranded so we’ll give you a warning if the last car is about to leave and you’re not on it.</p>

You can also send a request to the driver and ask if they can leave 30 minutes earlier than scheduled.  If they can, they will likely accommodate the request.  Drivers are encouraged to maximize the seat usage in their cars.  If you have to go in super early, then it is probably better for you to be a driver that day and post a ride for other riders to join you.</p>

						<h2 class="faq-header arvo">Is my credit card secure?</h2>

							<p>Yes.  Credit card security is critical and we take it very seriously here at Ridezu.  Our founders are actually ex-Visa and ex-PayPal employees and we really know our stuff.  Payment security is in our DNA.</p>
