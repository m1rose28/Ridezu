This User Agreement is a legally binding agreement made between you ("you," "your," or "yourself") and Ridezu Inc. ("Ridezu," "Ridezu.com," "we," "us" or "our").
<p>Ridezu.com is an online Service that enables persons ("Riders") who seek to get to and from work, typically by automobile, to find other persons ("Drivers") driving to and from near-by locations that are willing to share rides.

<h3>Arbitration</h3>

<p>Arbitration of Disputes. You and Ridezu agree that any disputes arising out of or related to the Service, this Agreement and/or any policies or practices of Ridezu (a “Dispute”) will be subject to FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION as set forth in this section, and may only be resolved through an individual arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. The only exceptions to this agreement to arbitrate Disputes are claims of infringement or misappropriation of Ridezu’s copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, service mark, trade dress or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, which Ridezu may elect to have resolved by means other than arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, Ridezu is always interested in attempting to resolve any Disputes by amicable and informal means, and we encourage you to contact us before resorting to arbitration. YOU AND RIDEZU AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH GIVING UP OUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT in connection with any Dispute, and that our rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
<p>a.	No Class Actions. YOU AND RIDEZU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER OF US WILL BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE WITH THE OTHE PARTY. Further, neither you nor Ridezu agrees to class arbitration or any arbitration where a person brings a dispute as a representative of other person(s). 
<p>b.	Arbitration Procedure. If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute by informal means, the arbitration of Disputes will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), a non-profit organization not affiliated with Ridezu, in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and if deemed appropriate by the arbitrator, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. 
<p>c.	Enforcement. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
<p>d.	Limitation of Time Period to Commence a Dispute. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any Dispute must be filed within one (1) year after the date in which the incident giving rise to the Dispute occurred. Failure to file an arbitration claim as described above within the applicable limitations period constitutes a waiver of such claim and serves as complete bar to any claim based on any Dispute. 

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>You may review our current Privacy Policy at Ridezu.com. If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way, please do not use or access our Service.

<h3>No Agency</h3>

<p>You and Ridezu are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.

<h3>Notices</h3>

<p>Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Ridezu shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Ridezu Inc., 15559 Union Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95032, and any notices to you shall be given to you via the email address you provide to Ridezu.com during the registration process. In such case, notice shall be deemed given 3 days after the date of mailing.

Alternatively, we may give you notice by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the address provided to Ridezu.com during the registration process.

<h3>General</h3>

<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by Ridezu, Inc. in our sole discretion in accordance with the "Notices" section of this Agreement. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

Sections referring to Service, Licenses, Liability Limit, Indemnity, and Resolution of Disputes shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
