Hi [$fname],

Thanks so much for joining Ridezu!  We've set up [$companyname] and you're ready to go.  

As a next step, you're going to want to go the admin page and add a logo as well your company location information.  Your company name and logo will be used with any experience on Ridezu.com with your employees.

Then you'll want to upload your employee data.  Your employee data is 100% secure and private and belongs completely to you.  We use this data to make registration easy for employees and for employees to find carpool matches.  Please note that any individual address will never be shared, even with other employees.

Finally, we'll help you message to your employees so that registration is a snap and your employees can start taking advantage of carpooling.  We find that it saves employees time, money and improves happiness and productivity in the office.

Ridezu is revolutionizing the way we get to work.  It all starts with you!  Got feedback or want to suggest an improvement?   Please let us know - we're very excited to have you on board!

Thank you,

Mark Rose 
CEO, Ridezu
