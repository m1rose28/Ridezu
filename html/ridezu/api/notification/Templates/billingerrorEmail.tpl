Hi [$fname],

<br><br>We tried to charge your credit card for your Ridezu usage last month but something went wrong and we werenâ€™t able to bill your credit card.

<br><br>Could you log into your Ridezu account and re-enter your credit card information?  Pretty please!

<br><br>Thanks,

<br><br>Team Ridezu
