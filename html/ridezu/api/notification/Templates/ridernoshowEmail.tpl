Hi [$fname],

<br><br>We heard that you were a no show for your ride today.  Boo!  A $10.00 fee has been assessed to your account (and credited to [$name(s)). 

<br><br>A no show is really bad for everyone. Don’t get benched!  Don’t get sent to the principal’s office!  Be sure to notify your fellow riders and drivers if you aren’t able to make it.  If you have continued no-shows you will be suspended from the service and no one wants that to happen.

<br><br>If this is not correct and we made a mistake, please let us know ASAP by replying to this email.  You have our sincere apologies for the glitch in communication.  The Matrix isn’t perfect you know.

<br><br>Thanks for your understanding.

<br><br>Team Ridezu
