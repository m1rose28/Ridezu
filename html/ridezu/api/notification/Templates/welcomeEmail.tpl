Hi [$fname],

Thanks so much for joining Ridezu!
 
We're putting together routes in your neighborhood to work destinations like your office.  New people are signing up everyday, and we don't expect that it will take too long before you can enjoy all the benefits of carpooling.  

So you can begin carpooling right as fast as possible, please watch our video and complete your profile on the Ridezu app.

As a special welcome bonus we've also credited your account with $10. You can use these funds for your first rides on Ridezu.  Also, for a limited time, if you refer your friends to Ridezu, we'll give you an extra $10 for each friend that joins.  Please see details on https://www.ridezu.com.  

Ridezu is revolutionizing the way we get to work and school.  It all starts with you!  Got feedback or want to suggest an improvement?   Please let us know - we're very excited to have you on board!

Thank you,

Mark Rose 
CEO, Ridezu
